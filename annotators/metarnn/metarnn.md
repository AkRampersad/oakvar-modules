# MetaRNN: deep learning-based ensemble pathogenicity prediction score
MetaRNN is a pathogenicity prediction score for human nonsynonymous SNVs (nsSNVs). It integrates information from 28 high-level annotation scores and produces an ensemble prediction model with a deep recurrent neural network (RNN). The final prediction is the likelihood of a nsSNV being pathogenic.  

Predictions will consist of either "T" for tolerated or "D" for damaging.
